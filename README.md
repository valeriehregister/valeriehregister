- 👋 Hi, I’m @valeriehregister
- 👀 I’m interested in Sakai development and maintenance.
- 🌱 I recently took over a job from someone who retired.  This job requires building Sakai from code for annual updates as well as maintaining the 5 current Sakai instances that our group currently has.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate and find help on Sakai 21 and up development and support.
- 📫 How to reach me ...valerie.h.register.civ@mail.mil
